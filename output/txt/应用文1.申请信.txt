Dear Mrs Zhou, 
I'm excited to learn from the school newspaper that the Young Volunteers Association is recruiting new members, and I am interested in it. 
In my opinion, the voluntary work can make a big difference to the life of those in need or to some communities, which is also my life goal. Through the voluntary work, I can not only enrich my life experience, but also learn how to put what I have learned into practice.
I am a student with an outgoing personality and a kind heart. Besides, I am good at management and love communicating with others. So I am eager to become a member of your association.
Looking forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely, 
Li Hua
