Dear Mr. Green,
There will be a Chinese folk music concert in our school with the aim of enriching our school life. Knowing that you are interested in Chinese folk music, I'd like to invite you to attend it.
The concert is to be held at 7:00 pm this Sunday in the lecture hall of our school, which features a lot of traditional Chinese folk music works. Some teachers and students will play beautiful pieces using traditional instruments. I'm sure they will give you a very impressive concert, through which you will learn more about Chinese folk music.
Looking forward to your coming.
Yours,
Li Hua
