3. 推荐信+地点介绍
Dear Terry, 
I'm delighted to know that you are planning experience Chinese culture and food  together with me and it's my pleasure. I'd like to recommend Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan Province.
Located in the southwest of China, Chengdu is so beautiful that it attracts millions of tourists every year. DuFu's Cottage, one of the most famous attractions, is well worth visiting. Not only can you learn something about the famous Chinese poet, but you can experience the garden built in traditional Chinese style. Besides, you can taste hot pot, which is famous worldwide.
 I hope you can find my recommendations helpful. Looking forward to your early reply.
Sincerely Yours, 
Li Hua
