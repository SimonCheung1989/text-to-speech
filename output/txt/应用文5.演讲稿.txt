5. 演讲稿--传统节日
Hello, everyone!
It's my honor to speak here. Today I want to talk about my favorite traditional Chinese festival — the Spring Festival . 
The Spring Festival, which is the most significant traditional festivals in China, begins on the eve of the lunar New Year, lasting fifteen days. There are a variety of activities taking place before and during the Spring Festival including cleaning and decorating houses, storing delicious snacks, posting couplets on the doors and so on. All that people feel is a festive atmosphere. What matters most is that all family members will return to their hometowns for a traditional family reunion and have a big dinner on the eve of the Spring Festival. People also watch TV gala until the clock strikes 12 and then set off fireworks and firecracker to welcome the New Year. During the next fifteen days, people pay a visit to relatives and friends, giving each other their best wishes.
While celebrating the Spring Festival, families can not only reunite but also experience and enjoy traditional Chinese culture. That's why I like it best. 
That's all. Thanks for your listening!
